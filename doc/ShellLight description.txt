Purpose

User friendly end user experience 
 - fast access to any feature in the system through shelllight launcher
 - fast startup even as the system develops (features is loaded async)
 - full keyboard control
 - you should allways know what the system is dooing (joblist support)
 - user specific behaviour

Fast, Easy and fun UI development
 - Rich behaviour with very little code (Conventions over configuration)
 - Everything in the UI is based upon commands


Inspiration:
 Windows7, SpotLight, Launchy, QuickSilver

Requires Silverlight 4, why?
 - MEF is used to decouple the feature modules from ShellLight itself
 - ICommand and databining to buttons is used to simplify the UI code

Developer Features:
 - Event publishing between UICommands throug EventAggregator from PRISM
 - All UICommands can bee accessed from each other through a simple ServiceLocator implementation
